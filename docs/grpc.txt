gRPC Documentation

1. We can make sample requests to the gRPC server at address: `localhost:5005` if we are within the cluster or `locahost:30005` from outside (30005 is the NodePort of the microservice `udaconnect-location-producer`)

2. Below is a sample code that make a request to create new location via gRPC:
```
channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:5005")
stub = location_pb2_grpc.LocationServiceStub(channel)

# Update this with desired payload
msg = location_pb2.LocationMessage(
    person_id=1,
    latitude="123123",
    longitude="123123"
)


response = stub.Create(msg)
```

3. `modules/microservices/location-producer/test_grpc_client.py` is a test script to help testing grpc server. We can run it by the following command:
