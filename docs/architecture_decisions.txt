Architecture Decisions

Decide to choose 3 types of message passing to leverage their advantages for different use cases:

1. RESTful APIs: For integrating with Frontend web application. REST is current industry standard, pretty simple to implement / maintain and integrate.

2. gRPC: For integrating with mobile application to receive device location, because of its overall better performance and payload size reduction compared to REST or other message passing techniques.

3. Message queue (over Kafka): For queuing location data so we can guarantee the system can handle large amount of data without breaking.
